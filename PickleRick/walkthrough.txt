tried to ssh in with user name and postential password found above. 
didn't work.

/assets shows a bunch of picture files.
do string and other reverse steganography attempts on them, nothing.

bang head against wall for 30min.
re-numerate web directory with gobuster specifying -x php,txt,js

login at ./login.php with username and potential password
do ls, interesting files:
cat command is disabled but you can use less to view read the files
Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt (1st flag)
clue.txt - says to look around the directories for flags

pwd shows we're in var/www/html
cd to / and ls, go to home/ 2nd flag is there
3rd flag is probably in the root folder but we don't have permission

create a reverse shell, upload linpeas.sh, chmod +x and run it
linpeas will tell you www-data (you) can run any command as root, so just do /bash and you got yourself root permissions
3rd flag is in /root

alternatively you don't have to use linpeas, just do sudo -l to check your permission and you will find the same info
then just sudo /root
